# Portal Deployment Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The portal service was failing to deploy on Render with the error:
```
CommandError: This script should be run from the Django Git checkout or your project or app tree, or with the settings module specified.
```

## Root Cause
The deployment failure was caused by:
1. **Poetry environment isolation**: Django management commands were not running with proper Python path context
2. **Working directory issues**: Commands executed without proper Django project context
3. **Build process optimization**: Missing proper error handling and validation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated render.yaml Configuration
- Simplified build process using dedicated build script
- Added health check endpoint configuration
- Optimized start command with proper Gunicorn settings

### 2. Created Build Script (`build.sh`)
- Proper Poetry installation and configuration
- Environment variable validation
- Django installation verification
- Configuration check before build
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 3. Created Start Script (`start.sh`)
- Production-optimized Gunicorn configuration
- Pre-start Django checks
- Proper error handling and logging

### 4. Added Monitoring and Validation
- Health check endpoint at `/health/`
- Environment variable validation script
- Post-deployment verification script
- Build optimization with `.renderignore`

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `/mnt/c/Users/louis/WebstormProjects/linguify/render.yaml`
- `/mnt/c/Users/louis/WebstormProjects/linguify/portal/portal/urls.py`

### Created Files:
- `/mnt/c/Users/louis/WebstormProjects/linguify/portal/build.sh`
- `/mnt/c/Users/louis/WebstormProjects/linguify/portal/start.sh`
- `/mnt/c/Users/louis/WebstormProjects/linguify/portal/validate_env.py`
- `/mnt/c/Users/louis/WebstormProjects/linguify/portal/verify_deployment.py`
- `/mnt/c/Users/louis/WebstormProjects/linguify/portal/.renderignore`

## Deployment Process

### 1. Build Phase
```bash
chmod +x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```

The build script:
1. Installs Poetry and dependencies
2. Validates environment variables
3. Verifies Django installation
4. Runs Django configuration checks
5. Collects static files
6. Runs database migrations

### 2. Start Phase
```bash
./start.sh
```

The start script:
1. Sets Django settings
2. Runs deployment checks
3. Starts Gunicorn with optimized settings

### 3. Health Monitoring
- Health endpoint: `https://openlinguify.com/health/`
- Returns JSON status for monitoring systems

## Environment Variables Required
- `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `DJANGO_ENV`: Set to 'production'
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated list of allowed hosts
- `DEBUG`: Set to 'False' for production

## Post-Deployment Verification
Run the verification script to ensure deployment success:
```bash
python verify_deployment.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
1. Check environment variables are properly set
2. Verify Poetry dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
3. Review build logs for specific error messages

### Runtime Issues
1. Check health endpoint: `/health/`
2. Verify environment variables in Render dashboard
3. Review application logs in Render

### Database Issues
1. Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is correctly configured
2. Check database connectivity from Render service
3. Verify migration status

## Performance Optimizations
- Gunicorn workers: 2 (suitable for starter plan)
- Request timeout: 60 seconds
- Max requests per worker: 1000 (with jitter)
- Static files served by WhiteNoise
- Build optimization with `.renderignore`

## Monitoring Recommendations
1. Set up health check monitoring using `/health/` endpoint
2. Monitor application logs in Render dashboard
3. Set up alerts for deployment failures
4. Monitor response times and error rates

This fix ensures reliable deployment and provides comprehensive monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities.
